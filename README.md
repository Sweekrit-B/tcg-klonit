## Dependencies

Next, weâ€™ll need to install the necessary packages.

1. Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
```
```bash
npm install
```

## Testing and Debugging

To test the MCP server, you can use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) without cloning the repository.

1. First, navigate to the `backend` directory if you are not in it already:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Run the following terminal command:
   
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node server.js
```

# Frontend

Contains base frontend setup meant offering base functionality after connecting to MCP.

# MCP SQL Integration

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with a PostgreSQL database, allowing you to query and inspect database tables through the MCP protocol.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the database connection:
   - The `.env` file in the backend directory contains the database configuration
   - Edit the `.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection details:
     ```
     PGHOST=your-database-host
     PGPORT=5432
     PGUSER=your-username
     PGPASSWORD=your-secure-password
     PGDATABASE=your-database-name
     ```

## Database Setup

Before running the server, you need to set up the database:

1. Make sure PostgreSQL is running on your machine
2. Run the setup script:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run setup
   ```

This script will:

- Create the database if it doesn't exist
- Create the necessary tables (users and products)
- Insert sample data

### PostgreSQL Installation and Configuration

If you're new to PostgreSQL, here's how to get started:

#### Installing PostgreSQL

1. **Download PostgreSQL** from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. **Run the installer** and follow the prompts
3. **During installation**:
   - You'll be asked to set a password for the `postgres` superuser
   - Remember this password - you'll need it to connect to the database
   - Keep the default port (5432)

#### Using the Default Configuration

The application includes default database configuration values:

To use these default values, you need to:

1. **Create the `mcp_user` in PostgreSQL**:

   - Open a terminal/command prompt
   - Connect to PostgreSQL as the superuser:
     ```
     psql -U postgres
     ```
   - When prompted, enter the password you set during installation
   - Create the user and grant privileges:
     ```sql
     CREATE USER mcp_user WITH PASSWORD 'mcp_password';
     ALTER USER mcp_user WITH SUPERUSER;
     ```
   - Exit psql by typing `\q` and pressing Enter

2. **Edit the `.env` file** to use these default values (or keep them as they are)

## Running the Server

Start the MCP server:

```
cd backend
npm start
```

## Using the MCP Inspector

The [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) is a powerful developer tool for testing and debugging MCP servers. It provides a visual interface to interact with your MCP server and test its tools and resources.

### Installing the MCP Inspector

You can run the MCP Inspector directly using npx without installation:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector <command>
```

### Inspecting Your SQL MCP Server

To inspect your SQL MCP server:

```bash
cd backend
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node server.js
```

This will:

1. Start the MCP Inspector client UI (default port 6274)
2. Start the MCP Proxy server (default port 6277)
3. Launch your SQL MCP server

Open the MCP Inspector client UI in your browser to interact with your server.

### Features of the MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector provides several features for testing your SQL MCP integration:

- **Tools Tab**: Test your SQL tools (`sqlQuery`, `listTables`, `tableSchema`) with custom inputs
- **Resources Tab**: Inspect available resources
- **Notifications Pane**: View server logs and notifications
- **Server Connection Pane**: Configure connection settings

### Example: Testing SQL Queries

Using the MCP Inspector, you can easily test SQL queries:

1. Open the MCP Inspector in your browser
2. Navigate to the "Tools" tab
3. Select the "sqlQuery" tool
4. Enter a query like `SELECT * FROM users`
5. Click "Execute" to see the results

### Customizing the Inspector

You can customize the MCP Inspector with environment variables:

```bash
CLIENT_PORT=8080 SERVER_PORT=9000 npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node server.js
```

For more details on using the MCP Inspector, see the [official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).

## Available MCP Tools

The server provides the following MCP tools:

1. **sqlQuery**: Execute SQL SELECT queries

   - Parameters:
     - `query`: SQL SELECT query with placeholders
     - `params`: Array of parameters to substitute in the query (optional)

2. **listTables**: List all tables in the database

   - No parameters required

3. **tableSchema**: Get the schema of a specific table
   - Parameters:
     - `tableName`: Name of the table to describe

## Example Usage

### Using the sqlQuery Tool

```javascript
// Example query to get all users
const result = await mcpClient.tool("sqlQuery", {
  query: "SELECT * FROM users",
  params: [],
});

// Example parameterized query
const result = await mcpClient.tool("sqlQuery", {
  query: "SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > $1",
  params: [500],
});
```

### Using the listTables Tool

```javascript
const result = await mcpClient.tool("listTables", {});
```

### Using the tableSchema Tool

```javascript
const result = await mcpClient.tool("tableSchema", {
  tableName: "users",
});
```

## Security Notes

- The server only allows SELECT queries for security reasons
- All queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection
- Consider using a dedicated database user with limited permissions
- The `.env` file contains sensitive information and is excluded from version control

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that PostgreSQL is running
2. Verify your database connection settings in the `.env` file
3. Ensure the database user has the necessary permissions
4. Check the server logs for error messages

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

#### OAuth Consent Screen Problems

**For External OAuth Type:**
- **Error "Access Blocked"**: Make sure you've added your email as a test user in the OAuth consent screen
- **"Your app isn't verified" warning**: This is normal for apps in testing mode, click "Advanced" and then "Go to [Your App Name] (unsafe)" to proceed
- **Token expired errors**: For External type in Testing mode, tokens expire after 7 days. Delete token.json and re-authenticate
- **"App doesn't have permission" error**: Ensure you've added the correct scope (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`) in the OAuth consent screen

**For Internal OAuth Type:**
- **Access denied errors**: Ensure you're using a Google Workspace account from your organization
- **"This app is only available to users in [Organization]"**: You can't use a personal Gmail account with Internal OAuth type
- **Email not on allowlist**: Contact your Google Workspace admin to ensure you have permission to access the API

#### OAuth Client ID Issues
- **"Error: redirect_uri_mismatch"**: Make sure you're using Desktop app credentials, not Web application
- **"The OAuth client was not found"**: Ensure your credentials.json file is correct and not corrupted
- **Invalid client secret**: Re-download your credentials.json from Google Cloud Console

#### Token Problems
- **"invalid_grant" error**: Your refresh token has expired. Delete token.json and re-authenticate
- **"Token has been expired or revoked"**: Same as above, re-authenticate
- **"Token used too early"**: Check your system clock to ensure it's set correctly

### API Errors

- **"Google Calendar API has not been used in project X before or it is disabled"**: 
  - Go to Google Cloud Console -> APIs & Services -> Library
  - Find Google Calendar API and ensure it's enabled
  - Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate after enabling

- **"Daily Limit for Unauthenticated Use Exceeded"**: OAuth is not working correctly, re-check your authentication setup

- **"User rate limit exceeded"**: You're making too many requests. Add delays between API calls

- **"Backend Error"**: Temporary Google issue, retry after a few minutes

### Code and Setup Issues

- **"Cannot find module"**: Make sure you've installed all dependencies with `npm install`

- **"ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'credentials.json'"**: 
  - Check that your credentials.json file exists in the specified directory
  - Verify the BACKEND_DIR path in server.js points to the correct location

- **"TypeError: client.connect is not a function"**: Ensure you're using the correct version of the MCP SDK

- **"Error loading the OAuth2Client library"**: Update googleapis package with `npm update googleapis`

### MCP Inspector Issues

- **"Error connecting to server"**: Ensure your server.js file is working correctly on its own first

- **Tool not showing up in Inspector**: Check that your tool definitions in server.js are correct

- **"Request timed out"**: Authentication may be hanging, check the console output of your server

### Frontend Issues

- **CORS errors**: Make sure your client is allowing cross-origin requests

- **"Cannot GET /"**: Check that the HTML file is in the right location

- **API endpoint errors**: Ensure the endpoints in the frontend match those in your client.js

### General Debugging Tips

1. **Check logs**: Always look at the console output from your server.js for error messages

2. **Test APIs step by step**: 
   - First verify authentication works
   - Then test basic actions like listing calendars
   - Then try more complex operations

3. **Validate credentials.json**:
   - Ensure it hasn't been corrupted
   - Confirm it contains the correct client_id and client_secret
   - Make sure you're using Desktop app credentials

4. **Reset and try again**:
   - Delete token.json to force re-authentication
   - In extreme cases, create a new OAuth client ID
   - Consider creating a new project if issues persist

5. **Check Google Cloud Console**:
   - Verify API is enabled
   - Ensure OAuth consent screen is configured correctly
   - Make sure you have the right permissions
